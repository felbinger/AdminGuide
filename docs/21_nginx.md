# NGINX setup

As mentioned in the introduction we are going to use an nginx as reverse proxy.

## Installation
The installation is quite simple:
```shell
sudo apt install nginx-full
```

I noticed, that nginx starts too fast on system boot. 
The ipv6 addresses which are added using `post-up` are not available at this time.
That's why we delay the start of nginx as mentioned [here](https://docs.ispsystem.com/ispmanager-business/troubleshooting-guide/if-nginx-does-not-start-after-rebooting-the-server). 

![Result of `systemctl status nginx`](img/nginx/nginx-failed-ipv6-not-assignable.png){: loading=lazy }

Edit `/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service` and add this line before the other `ExecStartPre` option:
```shell
# make sure the ipv6 addresses (which have been added with post-up) are there (only required for enabled nginx service on system boot)
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 5
```

To verify the mTLS client certificates, we need the cloudflare origin pull ca:
```shell
wget -O /etc/ssl/cloudflare_ca.crt https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/static/authenticated_origin_pull_ca.pem
```

## Adding a new Service
If we want to add a service, we have to follow this procedure:

1. Host the service, don't forget to adjust the port number.
2. Add a new ipv6 address for this service.
3. Configure the DNS (AAAA record).
4. Generate the origin server certificate in the Cloudflare dashboard and save the files on the server.
5. Create and enable the nginx vhost for the domain.
6. Test the nginx configuration and reload the nginx daemon.

## Example

Let's do this for the service [hedgedoc](services/hedgedoc.md):

### Setup the Service
Create the service directory
```shell
mkdir -p /home/admin/hedgedoc
```
Add the adjusted service definition (especially the port number!!!) and environment files from [here](services/hedgedoc.md).
```shell
vim /home/admin/hedgedoc/docker-compose.yml
vim /home/admin/hedgedoc/.postgres.env
vim /home/admin/hedgedoc/.hedgedoc.env
```
Start the service:
```shell
sudo docker-compose -f /home/admin/hedgedoc/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Assign a new ipv6 address
Generate a new random suffix for the ipv6 address.  
For example if you have a /64 network, you may generate 4 random hexadecimal blocks (== 64 bits)
```shell
v=$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc a-f0-9 | fold -w16 | head -n1)
echo ${v:0:4}:${v:4:4}:${v:8:4}:${v:12}
```
The prefix will be predefined by your isp / server hoster.
So in this example the prefix is `2001:db8:1234:5678`, let's say our script generated `5eca:dc9d:fd4e:6564`,
now our address for the new service is: `2001:db8:1234:5678:5eca:dc9d:fd4e:6564`
```shell
ip -6 address show eth0
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 state UP qlen 1000
      inet6 2001:db8:1234:5678::1/64 scope global 
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
      inet6 fe80::250:56ff:fe40:e00e/64 scope link 
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```
So now we can add the generated address to our interface. 
```
ip -6 address add 2001:db8:1234:5678:5eca:dc9d:fd4e:6564/64 dev eth0
```
Don't forget to add it to the `/etc/network/interfaces` configuration,
otherwise the address isn't persistent over reboots. Your configuration should look like this:
```shell
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
   
iface eth0 inet6 static
   # ipv6 address of the host
   address 2001:db8:1234:5678::1/64
   gateway 2001:db8::1
   # hedgedoc
   post-up ip -6 a add 2001:db8:1234:5678:5eca:dc9d:fd4e:6564/64 dev eth0
```

### Configure DNS
Now open the Cloudflare dashboard and navigate to the domain you would like to use to access your service.
Go to DNS and add the `AAAA` dns record for the subdomain you'd like:

### Generate Certificates
Next go to SSL/TLS -> Origin Server and create a new certificate for the subdomain:
![Image of certificate creation](img/nginx/create_certificate.png){: loading=lazy }
![Image 2 of certificate creation](img/nginx/create_certificate2.png){: loading=lazy }

   !!! info ""
      You can also create one cloudflare origin server certificate and use it for all vhosts for the specific domain it has been issued to.
      Consider wildcard certificates may [cause security vulnerabilities](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/News-Highlights/Article/Article/2804293/avoid-dangers-of-wildcard-tls-certificates-the-alpaca-technique/)

Make sure to save the resulting origin certificate in `/etc/ssl/hedgedoc.admin-guide.com.crt` 
and the private key in `/etc/ssl/hedgedoc.admin-guide.com.key`.

### Setup nginx vhost
In most cases the vhost configurations are similar to each other. 
Don't forget to adjust the port number in the proxy_pass directive according
to the configured port number of the service you created.    
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/hedgedoc.admin-guide.com`:
```nginx
# https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=nginx&version=1.17.7&config=modern&openssl=1.1.1d&guideline=5.6
server {
      server_name hedgedoc.admin-guide.com;
      listen [2001:db8:1234:5678:5eca:dc9d:fd4e:6564]:443 ssl http2;

      ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/hedgedoc.admin-guide.com.crt;
      ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/hedgedoc.admin-guide.com.key;
      ssl_session_timeout 1d;
      ssl_session_cache shared:MozSSL:10m;  # about 40000 sessions
      ssl_session_tickets off;

      # modern configuration
      ssl_protocols TLSv1.3;
      ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;

      # only allow cloudflare to connect to your nginx
      ssl_client_certificate /etc/ssl/cloudflare_ca.crt;
      ssl_verify_client on;

      # HSTS (ngx_http_headers_module is required) (63072000 seconds)
      add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000" always;

      location / {
         proxy_pass http://[::1]:8000/;
         proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
         proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
         proxy_set_header Host $host;
      }
}
```
Don't forget to enable the vhost:
```shell
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/hedgedoc.admin-guide.com \
   /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

### Test and apply configuration
Lastly we test the nginx configuration and apply it, if the test shows no errors:
```shell
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```
