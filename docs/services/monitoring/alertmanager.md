# Alertmanager

Sometimes monitoring is not enough and you want to be notified
about state changes in your system.
In a prometheus based monitoring infrastructure, alertmanager can handle this job.
In this example, we use msteams as the endpoint for notifications.

Add services to your monitoring `docker-compose.yaml`
```yaml
version: '3'

volumes:
  alertmanager:

services:
  alertmanager:
    image: quay.io/prometheus/alertmanager
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./alertmanager.yaml:/alertmanager.yaml:ro
    command:
      - --config.file=/alertmanager.yaml
#      - --web.external-url=your-domain
#    networks:
#      - monitoring
    ports:
      - 9093:9093

  msteams_receiver:
    image: quay.io/prometheusmsteams/prometheus-msteams
    restart: always
    environment:
      - TEAMS_INCOMING_WEBHOOK_URL="your-teams-webhook"
      - TEAMS_REQUEST_URI=alertmanager
#    networks:
#      - monitoring
```

---
Add your alerts directory to your prometheus service in the `docker-compose.yaml`

> You can find suggestions for alerts on [Awesome Prometheus alerts](https://awesome-prometheus-alerts.grep.to)

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  prometheus:
    ...
    volumes:
      - ./alerts:/alerts:ro
```

---
Register the alertmanager service, alerts and additional configs in your `prometheus.yaml`
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 30s
  evaluation_interval: 1m

rule_files:
  - '/alerts/*.yaml'

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
      - targets: ['alertmanager:9093']
```

---
Finally setup your `alertmanager.yaml`
```yaml
route:
  group_by: ['alertname', 'instance', 'job']
  repeat_interval: 15m
  receiver: 'teams'

receivers:
  - name: 'teams'
    webhook_configs:
      - send_resolved: true
        url: 'http://msteams_receiver_webhook'
```
