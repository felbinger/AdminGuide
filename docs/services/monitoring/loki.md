# Loki

You can use loki with a docker plugin to send the logs of your docker container to grafana:

Simply add the loki service definition to the `docker-compose.yml`, in which the monitoring services are defined.
```yaml
  loki:
    image: grafana/loki
    restart: always
    networks:
      monitoring:
        ipv4_address: "192.168.2.253"
```

Next may install the loki docker plugin:
```shell
docker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest --alias loki --grant-all-permissions
```

Finally you can configure the services (from a `docker-compose.yml`) to use loki instead of stdout for logging.

1. Add the following section to your `docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
x-logging: &logging
  driver: loki
  options:
    loki-url: "http://192.168.2.253:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
```

2. Apply the logging config on your service using yaml inheritance.
```yaml
    logging:
      << : *logging   
```
